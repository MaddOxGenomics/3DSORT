# 3D-SORT: Spatial Omics Reconstruction Toolset

3D-SORT (Spatial Omics Reconstruction Toolset) is a Python-based toolkit designed to streamline the processing, organization, and quantitative analysis of large-scale 3D spatial omics datasets. 
This includes multiplexed imaging modalities, serial-section reconstructions, spatial transcriptomics, and other high‑dimensional spatial biology data.

The library aims to provide a unified interface and dataformat for handeling, analyzing, and exporting 3D Spatial-Omics Data
