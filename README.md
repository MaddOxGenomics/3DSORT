# 3D-SORT: Spatial Omics Reconstruction Toolset

3D-SORT (Spatial Omics Reconstruction Toolset) is a Python-based toolkit designed to streamline the processing, organization, and quantitative analysis of large-scale 3D spatial omics datasets. 
This includes multiplexed imaging modalities, serial-section reconstructions, spatial transcriptomics, and other high‑dimensional spatial biology data.

The library aims to provide a unified interface for z‑stack handling, image registration, segmentation utilities, mask operations, intensity quantification, and structured data export — all optimized for high-throughput environments.
